# DR. Mal

We were provided an archive file called `drmal.zip` which contained a Word Document called `Mal.doc`. Since this was Forensics challenge and the document was called `Mal.doc`, it was safe to assume that this was a malicious document.

To analyse this malicious document, I first ran `oleid` from [oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) to analyse the document.
```console
$ oleid Mal.doc
oleid 0.60.1 - http://decalage.info/oletools
THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS - Check updates regularly!
Please report any issue at https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/issues

As seen in the output above, this document contains VBA macros. As stated in the output, we can use utilize `olevba` to get more info about the VBA macro.

```

From the output above, we are able to see the VBA macro. The macro of interrest is `MyMacro` as it creates a Windows Installer object to install `flagInstaller.msi` from `https://drmal.io.ept.gg/flagInstaller.msi`. 

Upon doing a GET request to the given URL we get the following output
```console
$ curl https://drmal.io.ept.gg/flagInstaller.msi
Invalid User-Agent
```

From the output it seems like we need to find a valid User-Agent in order to see the content. Since its the Windows Installer thats fetching the data, I decided to find the correct User Agent used by the Windows Installer.

By searching for `user agent for windows installer`, I found the following post: https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/View-download-and-export/Configure-trusted-client-user-agents-Windows-Installer-user/td-p/582721

In this post, its mentioned that the User-Agent is `Windows Installer`. By using User Agent in our GET request, we are able to fetch the flag:

```console
$ curl -s https://drmal.io.ept.gg/flagInstaller.msi -H "User-Agent: Windows Installer"
EPT{mAlD0c_c0mIn_sTr4igHt_0utt4_jAEr3n}
```
